- 👋 Hi, I’m @c-lark5
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development for web, mobile or game development in order to change careers. I'm currently a high school math teacher with some experience coding in high school and college.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# on Udemy, using a course designed to cover all the basics and advanced topics in coding with C#. I am open to learning other languages and have a Raspberry Pi robot that I can learn Python and Blockly on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects to help me increase my level of skill and work towards that career change.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I can be reached via email: eclark0955@gmail.com for questions, requests, or general collaboration.
